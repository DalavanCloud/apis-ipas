What it should look like:
-------------------------

 * First load: http://cl.ly/image/3O17290p000R
 * On selection: http://cl.ly/image/3R1g0b1k3v19
 * Various states: http://cl.ly/image/0d0z2b3i1V3M

How it should work:
-------------------
When a podcast is selected, the bottom panel should slide everything up (and scrunch up the logo)

Don't forget!
-------------
[ ] Have all four people across the bottom, at 25% width
[ ] All images must support retina (@2x)
[ ] All transitions should be smooth

Other things
------------
Currently only have Alex's picture done.
